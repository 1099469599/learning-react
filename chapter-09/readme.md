Chapter 9 : React-Redux
==================
In this chapter, we'll take a look at various ways to incorporate the Redux store. We will first look at how 
the store can be used without any additional frameworks. After that, we will explore react-redux, a framework that 
can be used to integrate a Redux store with React components.
